**Brightly** ✨

Brightly is a personal work system built to help you focus on what truly matters, without losing everything else along the way. It is designed as a single, living space for your work, learning, ideas, and reminders, not as separate lists or projects but as one connected system.

Instead of asking what should I do next, Brightly helps you answer a better question: what deserves my attention right now 🎯

**🚧 Brightly is currently under active development. This project exists primarily as a way for me to start coding seriously and build a real system from scratch. Expect rough edges, missing features, and frequent changes 🚧**

**Why Brightly exists 🧠**

Most task tools are built around workflows, categories, and projects. Over time, they become complex, fragmented, and mentally heavy. You end up managing the tool instead of your attention.

Brightly solves this by treating everything as part of one system. There is one main list where all items live. Nothing gets buried in folders or boards. You do not move things around to make them feel organized. You simply change their focus state, reorder them, and filter the same list when you need a different perspective.

Brightly also uses a focus based status model instead of a progress model. An item can be waiting, in progress, current, or done. Only one item can ever be current at a time. When you make a new item current, the previous one is automatically moved to in progress. This keeps your attention honest and prevents silent multitasking ⚡

The result is a calmer, clearer way to work, one that reflects how attention actually moves.

**Stack and technical notes 🛠️**

Brightly is a web application built with a modern, lightweight stack.

The frontend is written in React using Vite.
Styling is done with Tailwind CSS.
The backend uses Supabase, which provides a Postgres database and a JavaScript client.
The app is deployed on Vercel and uses environment variables to connect to Supabase.
